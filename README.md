# mcred

A general purpose Minecraft resource editor. Can open, create and edit recipes, models, block states, localizations. Also can view textures.

(Models are saved in mcred's own format, but will automatically be exported to MC format ("json model") or Wavefront OBJ, configurable per model. Or maybe not and I'll insert custom data into both of those formats, we'll see.)

_Or at least, that's what it'll be able to do, eventually. For now, it's just a pile of test code._
